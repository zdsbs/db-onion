Done:			
	DB Onion should automatically update your version number
	Apply only scripts that need to be applied (if version is at 4 start applying script 5)
	Reads scripts from disk and applies them in order to a db
	Commit after each script
	On exception don't commit the script + don't process future scripts

TODO:
	If you're missing a version you have 1,2,4 provide error feedback!
	If DB is not configured to be versioned (ie no version table) provide error feedback	
	When everything works print "yay we applied n-n'"
	build a jar of db onion
	create ant task for db onion - If there was error feedback stop build?
	configure db connection information
	Specifying / configuring the script directory

	Should script-file-filter do both file name and script version filtering?  Or can we split that in to two parts.  If so, un-comment deftest test-script-file-filter.
