Done: 			
	DB Onion should automatically update your version number
	Apply only scripts that need to be applied (if version is at 4 start applying script 5)
	Reads scripts from disk and applies them in order to a db
	Commit after each script
	On exception don't commit the script + don't process future scripts
  If you're missing a version you have 1,2,4 provide error feedback!
  If DB is not configured to be versioned (ie no version table) provide error feedback
  refactor db-onion to split into multiple files one, maybe one dealing with file i/o another with db stuff
  When everything works print "yay we applied n-n'"
	Build a jar (via leiningen)
	configure db connection information

TODO:	
	create ant task for db onion - Need to call through to the actual DBOnion
	If there was error feedback stop build?
	Specifying / configuring the script directory
	Check that we really work against an actual database
	Add ant task to create version table
  When DB Onion is pointed at a non-existent script directory, provide some feedback.
  Provide feedback if DB Onion is run and no scripts need to be applied.
  Need better error handling/reporting when connecting to the DB.  version-table-missing? treats any exception as if the version table didn't exist.
  Fix DB Onion to either not need the version initialized to 0, or to provide some useful error message otherwise.
  'Success' message incorrect when one or more scripts don't complete successfully.

	Should script-file-filter do both file name and script version filtering?  Or can we split that in to two parts.  If so, un-comment deftest test-script-file-filter.
